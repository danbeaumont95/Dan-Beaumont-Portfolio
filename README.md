# My Portfolio

## Introduction

This is the frontend for my new full stack portfolio site. This portfolio includes a brief description about myself, a list of projects I've worked on (which will be updated as I create more projects), my tech stack I've used in my career and a contact me form, which when the user fills out, it sends an email to my personal email
